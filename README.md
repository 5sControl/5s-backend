# Staff Control

Increasing workforce efficiency is one of the priority tasks for any company. 

Staff Control solution is:


*** Staff movement monitoring

*** Monitoring of presence in restricted areas

*** Time attendance

 *** Lock control

Staff Control analyzes video streams in real time using artificial intelligence technology. We do not use RFID tags, wristbands or other sensors, which simplifies implementation and maintenance of our solution. Staff Control is scalable without limitation in terms of the number of branches or employees. Staff Control is a server software with WEB-interface access. This system is more secure and does not require updates. With Staff Control the control functions can be integrated into the industrial internet of things architecture and provide a more successful and secure operation of your enterprise.
